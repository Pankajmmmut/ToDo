2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd todo-app`
3. (Optional) If you are using an IDE, import the project as a Maven project.
4. Build the application: `mvn clean install`
5. Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`
6. The application will start, and you can access it at `http://localhost:8080`

## Configuration

The application configuration can be found in the `application.properties` file. You may need to modify the database connection settings, server port, or any other properties based on your requirements.

The `ToDoApp` model represents a todo task with the following attributes:

- `id` (Long): Unique identifier for the todo task.
- `todoName` (String): Name or description of the todo task.
- `isTodoDone` (Boolean): Indicates whether the todo task is completed (true) or not (false).

## API Documentation

API documentation is generated automatically using SpringDoc and can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` (when the application is running). It provides detailed information about the available REST endpoints, request parameters, and responses.
